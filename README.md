# bisection_method
The program in Python to determine the solution of a nonlinear equation using the bisection. 
The code will compulsorily return the solution and the number of iterations to get a converged solution. 
Apart from that the function statement  also have the provision to print intermediate results such as solutions at intermediate iterations, 
plot of the input function, plot of the solution as function of iteration etc., when asked for Consider the following example
